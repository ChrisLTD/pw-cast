# PW Cast (Password Cast)

Creates a podcast feed in reverse chronological order from mp3 and m4a files in the /podcasts directory

Includes sample .htaccess and .htpasswd combo setup with user/pass = pw/cast

Remove `sample` from the file names and change the .htaccess file so it references the absolute path of the .htpasswd file

You can generate new htpasswd users using this tool http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/
